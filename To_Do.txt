This document includes a number of projects that need to be completed for full functionality.
They are written in the order in which they were found, as opposed to the order in which they should be done.

(1) The viewer does not properly render T-splines--particularly at EPs and at T-junctions.
    While the EP treatment is a whole different story, the T-junction one is one that is reasonably fixable

    Here, each face is sampled uniformly based on input resolution.
    Clearly, the resloution will be more sparse on the middle face compared to the other faces.
    Furthermore, typically vertices will not align along opposite sides of the same edge.
    Instead, an (unstructured) triangular mesh needs to be extracted which picks resolution
       along edges consistently based on some input resolution (so vertices on either side of an edge will align)
       and then the interior triangulation is selected via some unstructured generator
    Under this paradigm, the visualization around T-junctions should be fixed and continuity of the surface will be clear.
